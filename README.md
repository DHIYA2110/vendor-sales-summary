Vendor Sales Summary & Performance Analysis
üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor sales performance by integrating and transforming raw sales, purchase, pricing, and freight datasets into a single vendor sales summary table.
The analysis focuses on profitability, inventory efficiency, vendor contributions, and pricing strategies, with actionable business insights and visualizations.

## üîÑ Methodology
1. **Data Ingestion** ‚Äì All raw CSV files are loaded into `inventory.db` using `ingestion_db.py`.
2. **Data Transformation** ‚Äì `get_vendor_summary.py` merges purchase, sales, price, and freight data to create a **vendor_sales_summary** table.
3. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Missing values filled, data types fixed, and calculated metrics added:
   - `GrossProfit`
   - `ProfitMargin`
   - `StockTurnover`
   - `SalesToPurchaseRatio`
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** ‚Äì Performed in `vendor_performance_analysis.ipynb`.
5. **Visualization & Insights** ‚Äì Created impactful graphs to communicate business findings.

## üìä Key Insights & Visuals

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Vendor Contribution & Market Share**
![Pareto Vendor Contribution](reports/images/pareto_vendor_contribution.png)
- **Top 10 vendors** account for a significant percentage of total purchases, indicating a **high vendor concentration** and potential **supply chain risk**.
- Some vendors have **dominant purchase shares but lower sales performance**, signaling possible **inventory overstock** or **slow-moving goods**.
- **Strategic implication**: Consider renegotiating contracts with high-purchase but low-sales vendors to improve ROI.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Performance Leaders**
![Top Vendors by Sales](reports/images/top_10_vendors_by_sales.png)
![Top Brands by Sales](reports/images/top_btrands_by_sales.png)
- **Top Vendors by Sales** clearly show a **core group driving revenue**, making them priority partners for **marketing and promotional investments**.
- **Top Brands by Sales** reveal **customer preferences**, helping guide **inventory planning** and **brand-focused promotions**.
- **Strategic implication**: Allocate more shelf space and marketing budget to high-performing brands while monitoring underperformers for replacement.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Profitability Analysis**
![Vendor Profit Margin Distribution](reports/images/vendor_profit_margin_distribution.png)
![Profit Margin Confidence Interval](reports/images/profit_margin_confidence_interval.png)
- **Profit Margin Distribution** shows strong margins for certain vendors, while others have **thin or negative margins**, potentially due to **discount-heavy strategies** or **pricing misalignment**.
- **Confidence interval analysis** indicates a **clear performance gap** between top and bottom vendors, suggesting that **margin optimization** could boost overall profitability.
- **Strategic implication**: Prioritize partnerships with high-margin vendors and adjust pricing for low-margin brands.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing & Promotional Opportunities**
![Brands for Promotional Pricing Adjustment](reports/images/brands_for_promotional_pricing_adj.png)
- The **Promotional Pricing Adjustment scatter plot** identifies brands where **price changes** could stimulate demand without hurting profitability.
- **Strategic implication**: Run targeted price tests for low-selling, high-margin brands to increase turnover.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Purchase Efficiency & Cost Optimization**
![Bulk Purchase vs Unit Price](reports/images/bulk_purchase_vs_unit_price.png)
- **Bulk Purchase Impact on Unit Price** confirms that **larger purchase volumes** often secure **lower per-unit costs**, validating bulk procurement strategies.
- **Strategic implication**: Increase bulk orders for fast-moving products to maximize cost efficiency.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Pareto Vendor Analysis**
*(Already shown in Section 1)*
- Pareto chart confirms that **~20% of vendors contribute ~80% of total purchases**, reinforcing the need to **focus relationship management** on these key players.
- **Strategic implication**: Strengthen terms with the top 20% vendors to secure better pricing and priority supply.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Metrics from Vendor Summary**
- **Stock Turnover** analysis shows certain vendors have **slower-moving stock**, increasing **holding costs**.
- **Sales-to-Purchase Ratio** highlights inefficiencies in converting purchases into sales for some vendors.
- **Strategic implication**: Optimize reorder points and negotiate flexible purchase agreements for slow-moving inventory.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Automate data ingestion via scheduled ETL pipelines.
- Add forecasting models to predict vendor performance.
- Integrate dashboarding tools (Power BI / Tableau) for real-time reporting.
- Enhance data quality checks to handle missing or inconsistent records.
